# SphereFace: An Implementation

### 3/13/2021

This is my program implementation of SphereFace: Deep Hypersphere Embedding for Face Recognition. There were many issues I encountered along the way including having trouble adopting a data loading method that I could easily apply to the format of the LFW dataset, figuring out how to preprocess my training images and labels to allow the creation of test cases, and finally implementing my own four layer neural network to replicate the results produced in the paper. Although I faced several issues I was still sucsessful in training a twenty layer neural net with the angle loss function to enable validation on the test dataset. Overall, I still struggled greatly with this assignment due to the very limited time window in which this could be submitted (only a week for this assignment is not feasible for most students in my opinion). Despite this challenge I still learned a lot about common data preprocessing methods, loss function design and limitations, and general neural network architechture. 

Please refer to the github for full code and documentation.
